Novikov-Borodin A.V. Mathematical Restoration of Signals and Images Using Test Trials: A Non-Blind Approach. - Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, 2025, Vol. 65, No. 3, pp. 649â€“661. doi: 10.1134/S0965542524702105.

for signal recovery:

upload files with directories from the signal-rec directory;
run ts-rec.mw (Maple 2017 or higher);
or run CDEL-TG+n.cir and CDEL-Test+n.cir (Micro-Cap 12 or higher) to change initial data in DATA-n.xlsx.
for image recovery:

upload files with directories from the image-rec directory;
run ts-img-gr.mw (Maple 2017 or higher) for grey jpg image recovery;
or run ts-img-clr.mw (Maple 2017 or higher) for color jpg image recovery.
